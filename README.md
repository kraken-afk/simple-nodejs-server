# Simple web server using Nodejs and TypeScript
well, i don't have any idea what's going on, i'll learn so much about built in nodejs libs and how a web server actually works under the hood.

With this project hopefully i could understand how to handle many types of request from a client, e.g when a browser requesting MIME resources for html like javascript or css, etc.

## To-do's
- Create a simple server that return a web page.
- Create a rest API with CORS policy.
